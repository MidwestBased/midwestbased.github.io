			<p>Midwest startups are spread out, unconnected, while our West Coast brethrens are all concentrated primarily in the Bay Area with access to capital, large companies like Google, Apple and Facebook, and most importantly, each other.</p>
			<p>Now, with the amazingness that is Slack, we will connect with each other, help each other, and build off of each other.</p>
			<h4>Push "Let's Do It!" if you want to grow and connect with your startup brethrens.</h4>
